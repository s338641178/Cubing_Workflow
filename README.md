# _Cubing Workflow_

## Solving a Pyraminx
### _The data below includes obesrvation time to solve pyraminx_

## My times to solve pyraminx
### 1. 2:31:62
### 2. 1:34:46
### 3. 46:12 (PB)
### 4. 1:14:43
### 5. 1:07:78

## _Calculating ao5_
### Not counting best and worst times
### 1:34:46 + 1:14:43 + 1:07:78 / 3 = **_1:18:89_**

## _Methods used to solve_
### 1. The first thing I do is find the the three centers of one side
### 2. Next I to use the _R' L R L'_ to solve one side and put it on the bottom
### 3. Next, with the solved side on the bottom, if the other sides dont have the bottom row solved, I use _R U R'_ to solve the bottom row of each side
### 4. After that, depending on the case I use another algorithm to solve
###   a) When edges are on the right I use the algorithm **L R U R' U' L'**
###   b) When edges are on the left I use the algorithm **R' U' L' L U R**
###   c) If two edges need to be flipped I use the algorithm **R' L R L' U L' U' L**
###   d) The other case is the clockwise cycle where I use the algorithm **R U' R' U**

##_Next Steps/Goals_
### In the future, I would like to be able to solve the pyraminx at an average of about 30-45s instead of have an average or 1:18:89, in order to get there I think I need to work a bit more with the cube and try looking at it in different ways to understand what I need to do to solve it in fewer steps.
