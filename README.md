## Solving a Pyraminx
### _The data below includes obesrvation time to solve pyraminx_

## My times to solve pyraminx - October 17th
### 1. 2:31:62
### 2. 1:34:46
### 3. 46:12 (Best time)
### 4. 1:14:43
### 5. 1:07:78

## _Calculating ao5_
### Not counting best and worst times
### 1:34:46 + 1:14:43 + 1:07:78 / 3 = **_1:18:89_**

## _Methods used to solve_
### 1. The first thing I do is find the the three centers of one side
### 2. Next I to use the _R' L R L'_ to solve one side and put it on the bottom
### 3. Next, with the solved side on the bottom, if the other sides dont have the bottom row solved, I use _R U R'_ to solve the bottom row of each side
### 4. After that, depending on the case I use another algorithm to solve
###   a) When edges are on the right I use the algorithm **L R U R' U' L'**
###   b) When edges are on the left I use the algorithm **R' L' U' L U R**
###   c) If two edges need to be flipped I use the algorithm **R' L R L' U L' U' L**
###   d) The other case is the clockwise cycle where I use the algorithm **R U' R' U**

## _What I've Learned_
### Working with the pyraminx this past week has given me a much better understanding of how algorithms work and has allowed me to work through somthing in which I can have physical results and really see my progress in front of me. I hope that I can use this understanding of algorithms and apply it to coding and use it when coding projects in the future.

## _Next Steps/Goals_
### In the future, I would like to be able to solve the pyraminx at an average of about 45-55s instead of have an average or 1:18, in order to get there I think I need to work a bit more with the cube and try looking at it in different ways to understand what I need to do to solve it in fewer steps. I would also like to work with a pyraminx duo as well and maybe work toward using a rubik's cube in the future and continue working with different types of cubes.
